# Welcome to the Case Study ! 

## Detail on How to Navigate this Branch

1. First check out the [case study overview](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Case%20Study%20Overview.md) to understand context and the various models invovled in the case study.  


2. Download [note template](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Note%20Template.docxhttps://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Note%20Template.docx). Keep track of your discussion by taking notes on this document. 

3. Then pick your discussion. 
    - **[Discussion 1](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Discussion1.pptx)**: What clinical knowledge would developers need? 
    - **[Discussion 2](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Discussion2.pptx)**: What technical knowledge needed by physicians?
    - **[Discussion 3](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Discussion3.pptx)**: How can we design user interfaces to facilitate interdisciplinary communication?
    - **[Discussion 4](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Discussion4.pptx)**: What is needed to ensure successful deployment?
    - **[Discussion 5](https://github.com/gpostill/AIME25-AI-Workshop/blob/Case-Study/Discussion5.pptx)**: How should we navigate ethical considerations of models once deployed?  

Discussion can be done out of order and based on their relevance to the gorup present. We have number the discussions in order of the development --> deployment pipeline. Click discussion to navigate direclty to the discussion document.

## ðŸŽ¯ Case Study Learning Objectives

By the end of this case study, participants will be able to:
- Compare trade-offs between model complexity and clinical utility
- Understand how data modality affects model performance
- Identify validation gaps and fairness concerns
- Reflect on the ethical and implementation implications of AI in healthcare
