# The AI Learning Curve: What Physicians Need to Know About AI, and What Developers Need to Know About Medicine**.
**A workshop for the AIME 2025 Conference** 

Welcome to the official workshop site! This workshop is created through a collaboration with researchers at [T-CAIREM](https://tcairem.utoronto.ca) (University of Toronto) and the [AMA](https://www.ama-assn.org) (Ameriican Medical Assocaition). We designed the session for computer science and medical - both trainees and researchers alike.

## 💬 Workshop Abstract

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare is rapidly transforming medical practice. Successful deployment of AI models into healthcare requires interdisciplinary collaborations between clinicians and data scientists. Yet, such collaboration is impeded by the lack of shared understanding and language across disciplines. Additionally, there remains significant debate on the level of technical expertise required for healthcare professionals to safely leverage AI tools. 

This workshop will explore the core technical AI competencies necessary for clinicians using AI, as well as the tenants of healthcare that data scientists need to be aware of when developing AI for healthcare and health research. Through interactive discussions, case studies, and hands-on activities, participants will evaluate different AI education models, discuss legal and ethical considerations, and propose strategies fostering AI literacy among healthcare professionals. The session will conclude with structured data collection to capture participants' insights, informing a follow-up commentary on the evolving role of interdisciplinary collaboration and AI literacy in healthcare. To ensure the findings of this workshop translate to the broader community, our output will be a commentary summarizing the thoughts discussed in the workshop titled: **The AI Learning Curve: What Physicians Need to Know About AI, and What Developers Need to Know About Medicine**.

## 💬 Workshop Chairs

- **Gemma Postill**, MD/PhD Candidate, University of Toronto - As an MD/PhD Candidate, Gemma has expertise in AI applications in healthcare outcome prediction and clinical decision support. She also has expertise in medical education, having led multiple initiatives on AI literacy for healthcare professionals. Gemma is actively involved in medical education research to develop an AI competency framework, and separately a clinician scientist competency framework. Together, the research and education initiatives she leads help to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical implementation.
- **Dr. Kimberly D. Lomis**, Vice President for Medical Education Innovations at the American Medical Association - In that capacity, she guides the AMA ChangeMedEd® Initiative, partnering with medical schools, GME and CPD programs to impact over 30,000 medical learners across the United States. Themes of collaborative work and advocacy efforts among the institutions engaged in the initiative include competency-based medical education, training in health systems science across the continuum, development of master adaptive learners, coaching for health professionals, promoting diversity of the physician workforce and inclusive environments, addressing learner & faculty wellbeing, advancing educational technology and AI in medical education, and change management. Dr. Lomis oversees AMA’s Precision Education portfolio of projects leveraging data and technology to personalized and enhance medical education across the continuum.
- **Christopher Khoury** Vice President of strategic insights at the American Medical Association - He leads a unit comprised of a diverse team of researchers, analysts, and business professionals focused on assessing and interacting with emerging elements across health care, technology, and policy sectors. He has worked in the healthcare sector for over 22 years and serves on multiple advisory boards across health technology, venture, and social services.Christopher Khoury is vice president of strategic insights at the American Medical Association.
